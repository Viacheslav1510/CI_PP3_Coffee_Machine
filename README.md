## About

This is a command-line version of the classic Connect Four game for two players.

The classic game is played on a standing board with seven columns of six rows where two players take turns dropping coloured discs from the top to the bottom into a column of their choice. The piece falls straight down, occupying the next available space within the column.

The objective of the game is to be the first one to achieve a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of four connected discs.
