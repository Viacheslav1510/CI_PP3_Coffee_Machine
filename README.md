</details>

### Languages

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language for the logic of the program

### Frameworks & Tools

- [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) was used to draw program flowchart
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/) were used to store drinks menu, resources and profit
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-console/) was used to manage access and permissions to the Google Services such as Google auth, sheets etc.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used as a remote repository to store project code
- [Heroku Platform](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) was used to deploy the project into live environment

### Libraries

#### Python Libraries

- [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) - used to carry out testing on single units in validation.py file

#### Third Party Libraries

- [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) - Used this library to add color to the terminal and enhance user experience. I marked warning/error information with color red and user feedback with blue and green. Yellow color used for email verification. 
- [email_validator](https://pypi.org/project/email-validator/) - This library used to validate if user email input is of the form name@</span>example.com
- [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/) - Used gspread to add and manipulate data in the Google spreadsheet and to interact with Google APIs
- [google.oauth2.service_account](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - This module used to set up the authentification needed to access the Google API and connect my Service Account with the Credentials function. A creds.json file is created with all details the API needs to access the google account.
